# Paper Golf — notes for agents

Vite + TypeScript static site (no framework, no WebGL). Read README.md for the game rules, layout and the
performance rules; they are binding.

## Verify (always, before saying "done")

```sh
npm install
npm run check    # typecheck (TS 7) → lint (ESLint, zero warnings) → vitest → production build
npm run smoke    # Playwright smoke test against `vite preview` (system Chrome); not part of check
```

- Quote the `npm run check` output as evidence. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same on push to main.
- Pre-commit: husky (set up by `npm install` via `prepare`) and lint-staged (`eslint --fix` on staged files) are
  configured; the hook file `.husky/pre-commit` (one line: `npx lint-staged`) still needs adding — bot jobs can't write it.
- Type-check with `npm run typecheck`, not `npx tsc`: the root `typescript` package is 6.0 only because
  typescript-eslint needs its JS API; the app compiler is TS 7 (`node_modules/typescript7`).

## Architecture

- `src/engine/` — pure, deterministic rules: `rules.ts` (moves, terrain), `generator.ts` (60 seeded holes,
  validated solvable), `solver.ts` (expected Dice Golf strokes), `rng.ts`, `types.ts`. No DOM here.
- `src/game/game.ts` — pass-and-play state machine: turns, dice, mulligans, scoring. No DOM here.
- `src/ui/` — SVG board, 2D effects (die, ball, pencil), shot flight timing. `src/main.ts` wires UI to the game.
- `tests/` — vitest unit tests for engine, game flow and flight; `e2e/` — Playwright smoke test.
- Logic belongs in `engine`/`game` with a unit test; keep `ui`/`main.ts` thin.

## Rules

- TypeScript is strict with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`; ESLint is typescript-eslint `strictTypeChecked`.
  Fix the code. Never add `eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, `!` non-null assertions or silencing casts, and never
  loosen `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js` or a test to get green.
- Reuse the checked-access primitives instead of inventing new ones: `itemAt`/`must` (`src/engine/assert.ts`),
  `gridAt` (`src/engine/grid.ts`), `byId`/`query` (`src/ui/dom.ts`), and `at`/`defined` (`tests/helpers.ts`).
- **The repo is memory:** a mistake or bad pattern that happens twice becomes a check that fails — prefer
  structure/types, then a lint rule in `eslint.config.js`, then a test — committed with the fix, plus a one-line
  entry under "Lessons" below.

## Lessons

- typescript-eslint does not support TS 7's API yet: keep `typescript` at 6.0 for lint, `typescript7` for builds.
